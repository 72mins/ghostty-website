First you'll need to create a script file with a `.sh` extension. This file will need to be executable, so give it execute access via [chmod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod). In a terminal, run the following:

```shell
touch hello.sh         # Create a file, using the `.sh` extension
chmod +x hello.sh      # Change it's permissions to be executable
```

> You can copy this **comments included** and run it in your terminal. The comments will be ignored!

With your preferred text editor, paste the following into the newly created file:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Hello World"
```

You can now execute your bash script by calling it via `./path/to/the/script`. Because we are in the directory that the script is located, we will run the following:

```shell
./hello.sh
```

```txt
Hello World
```
