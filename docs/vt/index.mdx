  Available APIs for developers writing applications that run in
  Ghostty.

Programs running in terminals use **control sequences** to interact with the
terminal. Control sequences are a series of special characters that the terminal
interprets as commands. This is sometimes referred as **VT sequences** or
**escape codes**.

This page will document the types and syntax of control sequences
within Ghostty. For a full list of supported sequences, see the
[reference](/docs/vt/reference).

## Control Characters

Control characters are single byte characters that have a special
meaning. They have no encoding format; you send the bytes as-is.
For example, [backspace](/docs/vt/control/bs) is `0x08`,
[linefeed](/docs/vt/control/lf) is `0x0A`, etc.

There are very few control characters, but they're important
to be aware of because the single byte value impacts the terminal
state.

## Escape Sequences

Escape sequences are in the format below. An example escape sequence
is `ESC D`.

```
esc_sequence = "0x1B" intermediates final
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x30-0x7E]
```

## CSI Sequences

CSI sequences are in the format below. An example CSI sequence
is `ESC [ 1 ; 2 m`.

```
csi_sequence = "0x1B" "[" params intermediates final
params = param | param sep params
param = [0-9]
sep = ";" | ":"
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x40-0x7E]
```

## DCS Sequences

Ghostty supports DCS sequences but these aren't yet documented.

## APC Sequences

Ghostty supports APC sequences but these aren't yet documented.
