  Available APIs for developers writing applications that run in

Programs running in terminals use **control sequences** to interact with the
terminal. Control sequences are a series of special characters that the terminal
interprets as commands. This is sometimes referred as **VT sequences** or
**escape codes**.

Control sequences are typically poorly specified, so this section
serves both as a reference of what Ghostty supports as well as
a possible reference for other terminal emulators.

## Control Characters

Control characters are single byte characters that have a special
meaning. They have no encoding format; you send the bytes as-is.

| Name | Byte | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [BEL](/docs/vt/control/bel) | `0x07`  | Alert the user (beep) |
| [BS](/docs/vt/control/bs) | `0x08`  | Move cursor backward one position |
| [TAB](/docs/vt/control/tab) | `0x09`  | Move cursor right to the next tab stop |
| [LF](/docs/vt/control/lf) | `0x0A`  | Move cursor down one line, scrolling if necessary |

## Escape Sequences

Escape sequences are in the format below. An example escape sequence
is `ESC D`. Below the syntax is a table of supported escape sequences
in Ghostty.

```
esc_sequence = "0x1B" intermediates final
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x30-0x7E]
```

| Name | Sequence | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [IND](/docs/vt/esc/ind) | `ESC D` | Move cursor down, scrolling if necessary |

## CSI Sequences

CSI sequences are in the format below. An example CSI sequence
is `ESC [ 1 ; 2 m`. Below the syntax is a table of supported
CSI sequences in Ghostty.

```
csi_sequence = "0x1B" "[" params intermediates final
params = param | param sep params
param = [0-9]
sep = ";" | ":"
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x40-0x7E]
```

| Name | Sequence | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [CUB](/docs/vt/csi/cub) | `CSI Pn D` | Move cursor left |
| [CHT](/docs/vt/csi/cht) | `CSI Pn I` | Move cursor right `n` tabs |
| [TBC](/docs/vt/csi/tbc) | `CSI Pn g` | Clear one or all tab stops |
