Programs running in terminals use **control sequences** to interact with the
terminal. Control sequences are a series of special characters that the terminal
interprets as commands. This is sometimes referred as **VT sequences** or
**escape codes**. This section will document all of the control sequences that
Ghostty supports.

## Control Characters

Control characters are single byte characters that have a special
meaning. They have no encoding format; you send the bytes as-is.

| Name | Byte | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [BEL](/docs/vt/bel) | `0x07`  | Alert the user (beep) |
