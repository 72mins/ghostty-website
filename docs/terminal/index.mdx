Ghostty is a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that aims to push the boundaries of what is possible with a terminal emulator by exposing modern, opt-in features that enable CLI tool developers to build more feature rich, interactive applications.

There are a number of excellent terminal emulator options that exist today. The unique goal of Ghostty is to have a platform for experimenting with modern, optional, non-standards-compliant features to enhance the capabilities of CLI applications. We aim to be the best in this category, and competitive in the rest.

While aiming for this ambitious goal, our first step is to make Ghostty one of the best fully standards compliant terminal emulator, remaining compatible with all existing shells and software while supporting all of the latest terminal innovations in the ecosystem. You can use Ghostty as a drop-in replacement for your existing terminal emulator.
