title: Prebuilt Ghostty Binaries and Packages
description: |-
  Install Ghostty without building it manually by downloading
  and running a prebuilt binary or package.
---

The Ghostty project only officially provides prebuilt binaries
for macOS. Other platforms may provide packages for Ghostty,
but those packages are maintained by the community. This page will
list both official and community-provided binary packages.

## macOS

Official macOS binaries are provided by the Ghostty project and
are available on the [download page](/download).

These binaries are signed and notarized by the Ghostty project.
To install, download the `.dmg` file, open it, and drag the
Ghostty application to your Applications folder. This is the same
process as installing many typical macOS applications.

### Homebrew

A Homebrew cask is available and maintained by the community.

```bash
brew install ghostty
```

## Linux

Pre-built Linux binaries or packages are provided by the community.
At the time of writing, no community-provided packages are available
because Ghostty has only recently been publicly released. This page
will be updated as community-provided packages become available.

If your platform isn't available, you must
[build Ghostty from source](/docs/install/build).

<Tip>
  **Interested in creating a package for your platform?** Check out the
  [packaging
  guide](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/PACKAGING.md). If you
  need any help, feel free to make an issue. Once your package is ready, submit
  a pull request to add it to this page!

### Nix Flake

There is Nix package that can be used in the
[Ghostty flake](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/flake.nix)
(`packages.ghostty` or `packages.default`). This is a good way
to track specific commits of Ghostty.

While the Ghostty project does not maintain any official packages for
Linux, Ghostty maintains an in-repo Nix flake because Nix is used as
our primary development and CI environment. The Ghostty project does
not maintain any official NixOS packages (in `nixpkgs`).

Below is an example:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    ghostty = {
      url = "github:ghostty-org/ghostty";
    };
  };

  outputs = {
    nixpkgs,
    ghostty,
    ...
  }: {
    nixosConfigurations.mysystem = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        {
          environment.systemPackages = [
            ghostty.packages.x86_64-linux.default
          ];
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Arch Linux

The recommended way to install Ghostty is to install the existing package in the
`extra` repository. This package is maintained by the community.

```sh
pacman -S ghostty
```

#### AUR

There is also an AUR package
[ghostty-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ghostty-git)
being maintained that builds against the `main` branch.

```sh
# Install Ghostty tip
yay -S ghostty-git
```
