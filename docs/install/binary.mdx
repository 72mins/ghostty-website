title: Prebuilt Ghostty Binaries
description: |-
  Install Ghostty without building it from source by downloading
  and running a prebuilt binary.
---

The Ghostty project only officially provides prebuilt binaries
for macOS. Other platforms may provide binary packages for Ghostty,
but those packages are maintained by the community. This page will
list both official and community-provided binary packages.

<Note>
At the time of writing, Ghostty has only recently been publicly
released. As a result, the number of community-provided binary
packages is zero. This page will be updated as community-provided
packages become available.
</Note>

## macOS

Official macOS binaries are provided by the Ghostty project and
are available on the [download page](/download).

These binaries are signed and notarized by the Ghostty project.
To install, download the `.dmg` file, open it, and drag the
Ghostty application to your Applications folder. This is the same
process as installing many typical macOS applications.
